To run compile the program run: make

To run the program run: count <input-filename> <search-string> <output-filename>

To remove the executable run: make clean

I've included the test files provided on Canvas under the testFiles folder. 

All the files can be tested with using: make test, which will run the program for each test file.

Output will be put in corresponding output files under the exampleOutput folder

A file name check.c has also been added, which simply reads and prints an input file.

To compile run: make verify

To run the program run: check <input-filename>

This can be used to vefiy the content of the output files from count.
