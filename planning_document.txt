Lab 1 - Planning Document
——

Steps needed:
Get file name from args
Open file
Read from file - how many bytes at a time

Get search string from args
Get first letter of search string
Iterate over first input bytes looking for first letter
	if first letter is found does the next letter match
		if not begin checking again for first letter
	check each letter to see if it matches first letter
		if yes store that position for reiteration later.
			only store this once

After each match begin searching for first letter again
	if first letter position was saved at some point return to that position

Once the bytes read have been integrated through read in more bytes until EOF

At EOF close read file

Open write file
Write the count and bytes to write file
Close write file

Print count and bytes to command line

End

Keep a count of the number of times a word is found
Keep a count of the number of bytes read


Variables needed:
	count
	bytes
	file name
	file open
	string from file read
	search string
	first letter of search string
	next letter in search string

	write file name
	write file open

Functions needed:
	open file read
	read bytes from file
	close file read
	open file write
	write to file
	close file write
	main
	search
